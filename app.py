Provenance Guard — the web service.

Then, in another terminal:

    curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/ping \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{"message": "hello"}'

That's the example route. It works right now, before you've written anything.
**Leave it alone** — it's your control. When something breaks later, check that
`/ping` still answers: if it does, the problem is in your handler; if it
doesn't, it's the service itself.

Routes:

    POST /ping        the worked example. Already works. Don't edit it
    POST /submit      ← YOU BUILD THIS (Milestone 3, 4, 5)
    POST /appeal      ← YOU BUILD THIS (Milestone 5)
    GET  /log         the audit log. Already works
    GET  /health      is the service up, and is the model loaded
